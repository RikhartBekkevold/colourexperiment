# Colour Experiment - IMT 4315 - Colour in Interface Design

## Purpose
Program created as part of an experiment to test the effects on comprehension of programming code when
the code was both colour coded (CC) and non-colour coded (NCC). The effect is defined as the time to complete
tasks.  

## Code
Flexibility is limited due to some parts being hardcoded. Might not be suitable to perform
other types of experiments with.

## Data
Experiment data recorded:

- Time to complete each task in milliseconds
- The answers given for each task
- Total time

The data is recored at the end of the last screen, so closing the tab or browser midway will not
record any data.
