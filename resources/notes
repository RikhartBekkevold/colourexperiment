variable called order, 1 or 0 that indicated which order the ncc/cc is in? just used the random variabled generated
need the total for ncc and cc, not total of all

if the diff is smaller compared to time they used overrall? rank them on skill based on the time they used to complete. if diff between ncc and cc decreases when
total time decreases.

then dont need their self evaluation

success (for each task) to see if the time they use is realistic

also determine, ask for colour blindness to make sure.

i'll use questionaree. to have many more people.

more colour
questionnare for more ppl
time for experience

use same principle as them for task equality

use diff

prep statement
mention its timed?

randomize

opacity to see behind
box shadow to be closer to you than other elements


what color is diff is not to important. but font, size, contrast etc might be.


help less or more if tired? might be relevant since it might mean low contrast is good

define criteria. make research to know what to do to fullfill the criteria.

individual comparison - their own group


teach them or mentally prepare them

since i dont care whether one task is harder than the other no need to ranomize task - tasks are not compared against eachother
randomize ncc, cc, fcc though


should i tell them its timed?


same task thrice is probably pretty tedious.

send research

serves as:
perfect size - can do upload and improve more and more
colour
web
interaction design
portfolio all in on
making packages and publish with npm
can make addons for atom

//total not that useful
//total for ncc and cc is critical though

// note it as weakness:
//didnt follow colour pricniples
//two different colour schemes


//research shows ncc and cc matters. now we test the effect on the amount of color. and we also compare to the experience, but we measure experience (as time)
// differently. with years as a backup.





high chroma = more vivid?
less chorma = bland?
