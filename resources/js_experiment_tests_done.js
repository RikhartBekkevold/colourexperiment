// helps visual search if known in advance

// amount trumps accuracey
// "this depends on ncc and cc tasks being equally challenging in understanding what they do"
//i think it will work, but i have to test it first. think ppl acutally have to think equally hard for both

//about using ppl i know

//3 probs to solve, not too many, fatigue

//even if you see that its just reversed, you still need to calculate it... not entirely satisfied, but good that controls only one

//perform calc. return depending on wheter the value is high or low. repeat or single value?

//minimaizing, not completely perfect
//develop a framework?

//same amount of calculatiuons needed? 10 vs 20. but same amount of loops? easier for ppl with additions? one is standrard the other is not. so maybe just do it
// for formulas?

// These variations included reversing the direction of an inequality,
// replacing additions with subtractions, or interchanging the arguments

// 3 tasks, they mentioned all 3 then?

//names dont give away meaning - so thats one way understanding the meaning can be quicker for one task, if the name gives away more
//different names like y and x? or same?

//even though they realize its reversed, they still need to calculate the outcome

//two approaches:
// look the same. but have different semantics.
// look different, but are really the same task/equal difficulty. as long as they realize only at end that its the same task.
//this is harder because the tasks differ in more ways then just one deliberate change? but wont run the risk of them understanding
// that its the same task with a small difference?

//test the tasks tomorrow. have the equallity now

// goal: alot of ppl


//same structure. different meanings. output.
//wont they recoqnize the structure and be faster that way?
//or do they have to

//this is the easiest way to have under control how they are different. because everything same except one variable

//nr of diff colour we see in task, does it make it quicker? but then have to make each task equall difficulty also, not just the pairs

//equally hard to solve
//these should be equally hard to solve, they look the same, but they produce different outputs


//as im struggling with sources i could use her research
//wanted feedback before presentation, but...
//if all do all, how should randomization be done?


//how can we improve their skills?
//what if we change the color subtly? does it matter?


// data/values to record:
//time: the time it took to complete task in seconds
//success: true/false (0/1) - for control
//skill/language familiarity/ level:     diminishing effect with skill?


//time: seconds
//sucess: true/false (0/1)
//skill/language familiarity/ level:     diminishing effect with skill?



//different tasks. diminsning effect with different tasks?
//different langueges
//different highlightings, like nr of colours, dark or white bg. testing somethign else I think

//not experience in programming, but the language...

//so record their experience with the language? isnt this the same as prog skill?

// is this effect diminished the more you understand the language?

//so i dont record how long programmed, or year, just if they know the language or not? true/false or a continium?

//assessing skill level, how? - use something else? do they have any idea to assess skill?
//making sure tasks equally difficulty/or new design, but then have less ppl

//therefore something easier?
//gender, age,
//color deficiencies, need to find out first - present the colors first? this also makes it so that they know the cc beforehand?

// Fatigue — Mental or physical fatigue reduce our ability to match color accurately.



//"It is timed"

//vars that effect understanding

//x = counter

// avoid functions from libs
// use names that do not give away the functionality (which is normally what you want. name is another
// way of understanding code, semantics, so remove the variable). and for consistency naming.
// easy enough for everyone to do. time to complete will vary based on skill.
// hard enough that it encourages analytical thinking

if they are fimiliar with it, and how long, years, as measure of expeirence
do those with lots of experience programming in js benefit less from it?

expeirnece
skill
or language knowledge

length of code
nr of colours

imporve by having more
buiild on to see if extends to longer code snippets. most likely, but might not diminish for experienced ppl.

To the knowledge of the author there is a similiar study, but this had a weakness of two feew eople. the aim is to build upon
the sample pop to further strengthen the evidence/conclusion/any thing else?.


kept it simple because studies indicate that the skill is lower than thought.
