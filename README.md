## Colour Experiment - Colour in Interface Design

# Purpose
Program created as part of an experiment to test the effects on comprehension of programming code when
the code was both colour coded (CC) and non-colour coded (NCC. The effect is defined as the time to complete
tasks. The time is recorded in milliseconds.     

# Code
Flexibility is limited due to some parts being hardcoded. Might not be suitable to perform
other types of experiments with.

# Data
Experiment data recorded:

- Time to complete each task in milliseconds
- Total time
- The answers given for each task


The data is recored at the end of the session, so closing the tab or browser will not
record any data.
